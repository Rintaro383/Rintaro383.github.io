<h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>
<p>
In 1874 Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood, and
fossil fuels were not available. Orlando Darling built a dam across the
Kansas River north of town and strung mechanical cables from a water
wheel to power local industries. Justin Bowersock bought the operation,
naming it "The Bowersock Mills & Power Company" (<dfn>Bowersock</dfn>).
